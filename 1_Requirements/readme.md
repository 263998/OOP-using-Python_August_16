# REQUIREMENTS MD FILE

## Introduction
To implement OOP concepts using rectangle and sqaure classes
In this project i have used following python oops concept
1. Classes and objects
2. Defining methods inside classes
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstract class and method concept

## Polygon area calculator
It will take inputs from user
1. Choice for polygon
2. Calculation Required:

       * Enter 1 for rectangle
       * Enter 2 for square
     
if choice is neither 1 or 2, the program terminates with invalid input.

## 4W's and 1'H

### Who:
* People eho require easy calculation of polygon parameters in one place.
* Students and teachers for quick abd easy calculation.

### What:
* It takes various inputs and calculates polygon parameters.
* Also prints the shape of the polygon.

### When:
* When fast and easy calculation and visualisation ofpolygon is required

### Where:
* It is simple and user-friendly.
* It can be used anywhere around the world by anyone.

### How:
* The system aims to provide smooth experience for users and should be implemented in least possible cost and efficient way.
